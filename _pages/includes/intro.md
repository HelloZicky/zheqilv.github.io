[//]: # (**Rongjie Huang &#40;黄融杰&#41;** is the final year's graduate student at College of Computer Science and Software, [Zhejiang University]&#40;https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/&#41;, supervised by [Prof. Zhou Zhao]&#40;https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou&#41;. I also obtained Bachelor’s degree at Zhejiang University. During my graduate study, I was lucky to collaborate with the CMU Speech Team led by [Prof. Shinji Watanabe]&#40;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5xRA6QAAAAJ&#41;, and Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University. I was grateful to intern or collaborate at TikTok, Shanghai AI Lab, Tencent Seattle Lab, Alibaba Qwen, with [Yi Ren]&#40;https://github.com/RayeRen&#41;, [Jinglin Liu]&#40;https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver&#41;, [Chunlei Zhang]&#40;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NCKZGb0AAAAJ&#41; and [Dong Yu]&#40;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ&#41;.)
I am about to receive my PhD in June 2025 from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor [Fei Wu (吴飞)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/wufei). From December 2023 to January 2025, I was a visiting researcher at the NExT++ Research Center at the National University of Singapore, under the supervision of Professor [Tat-Seng Chua (蔡达成)](https://www.chuatatseng.com/).

[//]: # (My research interest includes **Multi-Modal Generative AI, Multi-Modal Language Processing, and AI4Science**. I have published **first-author papers** at the top international AI conferences such as **NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/ACL/IJCAI**. I developed a few well-known Speech/NLP algorithms including:)

[//]: # (- AudioGPT, UniAudio, Make-A-Voice: Multitask, Multilingual LLMs)

[//]: # (- Make-An-Audio, GenerSpeech: Zero-shot text-guided synthesis)

[//]: # (- FastDiff 1/2, ProDiff: AIGC diffusion models)

[//]: # (- TranSpeech, and AV-TranSpeech: Multimodal Translation)

My main research areas are:
- (Multimodal) Large Language Models, including self-reflection, quantization, applications, etc.
- Device-Cloud/Large-Small Model Collaborative Learning.
- Information Retrieval/Recommendation.

[//]: # (In 2024, I lead or participate in the following research topics:)

[//]: # (- Speech/NLP: multimodal generation and translation)

[//]: # (- Large Language Models &#40;LLMs&#41;: Audio/Visual)

[//]: # (- Diffusion models: Image/Audio/3D)
